# Forms for Firefox Data Collection Review Process

This respository contains templates for the Firefox data collection review process.  

New Firefox data collection (for the client, e.g. telemetry) and services (e.g. Firefox Accounts) must be reviewed and approved prior to deployment of collection code. Our data collection review process is designed to ensure that data collection meets our data and privacy policies and that there is sufficient documentation for all data collection in Firefox.  

If you are seeking review for new data collection, please use the request.md form in this repository.  Data stewards should fill out the review.md form in this repository in response to a request.  We provide both forms so that requesters know what stewards are looking for when performing a review of a request for data collection.

You can read more about the process and view a current list of data steward peers here: (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Data_Collection)
